    <h2 id="join">Why did I join Generation?</h2>
    <p>I tried starting my own website business, but lacking confidence, 
        I was having a hard time getting clients.  Seeing that Generation not only 
        teaches JavaScript and Java but also helps with interview skills and
        works with partner companies for apprenticeships, I thought it would be 
        a great opportunity.
