                <h2>Joining</h2>
                        <P>I wanted a career change and wanted to go back to graphic design or similar. I was always interested in web design or web developing. A cousin of mine told me about a bootcamp program that it is attending to check it out. Before I joined generation, I went on youtube and udemy.com to practice coding. Since then I was very interested in joining a bootcampe program. I found generation in a social media platform and applied to join the program. </P>

                        <h2>Life After Generation</h2>
                        <p>I'm planning to land a junior web developing job and gain the experience to become a freelnacer. I see a lot of opportunities in this web developing industry to start a business.</p>
